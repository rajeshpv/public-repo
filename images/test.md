If I understand this correctly, getting a new backyard garage to the front-left-house of my property, needs an entrance to garage by the road, which is the common road 
a) continued left turn road for future community and 
b) future straight road extension.

A) Following are reasons from IW community persepctive:
There are only 2 houses facing their-side on Cherokee, and we have 3 houses directly facing the Cherokee road.
1) Cherokee Rose Court is such a small road the entering traffic and leaving traffic at intersection at Pantego makes it difficult/dangerous.
2) There is Kiosk right in front of my property:
Where cars do park for 10 mins to pickup mail, so adding another driveway makes it difficult for mail-pickup.
3) Today house 1713 is asking for permission
•	Tomorrow the other house in front of Cherokee can also demand to open garage entrance from side too, there is no reason to stop him.
•	If we allow for this property alone. And soon all properties at corner sites can view this as an advantage, that too particularly with basement they can even sublet. Since the common laws of housing does not prevent sub-renting basement.
4) Coming to traffic and narrow IW roads (I am referring to main IW entrance): 
•	We know very well, right at entrance when repair/lawn care trucks stop as wel as (second house at entrance) has rental of chairs pickup etc., which blocks school bus many a times. 
•	We have felt and understood the traffic and congestion, This will increase congestion at Cherokee, that too right at T-intersection.
5) Recently I noticed a complaint from a resident who is not-living on Cherokee but on continuing-to-Cherokee road complain about parking on side of narrow road (by work truck) which describes the issue.

So definitely NO from IW community perspective.

B) Following are reasons from My property perspective:
There are only 2 houses faces the their-side on Cherokee, and we have 3 houses directly facing the road.
a) When I bought or saw the plan at time of purchase never had thought the future construction of JUST garage would change the layout+look for future buyer of our property.
b) It blocks the open-view and light to my house which I enjoyed as open area in front of my house for past 7 years. I do not want the good view to be blocked, so it is a NO from my side.

 so It is a definitely NO from current and future next-buyer perspective, I do not want to decrease the value from what I had bought or expected during purchase of this property.
 
 
If increase of driveway sounds like a viable solution for more parking space say 2+cars. Then I have noticed few houses in Pantego cul-de-sac have broadened the drive way -, by even keeping entrance of drive way intact. Below is the link.
